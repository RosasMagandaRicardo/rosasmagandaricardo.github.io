        <h3>by Edgar Allan Poe</h3>
        <h3>(published 1850)</h3>
        <p>
          THE chateau into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance, rather than permit me, in my
          desperately wounded condition, to pass a night in the open air, was one of those piles of commingled gloom
          and grandeur which have so long frowned among the Appennines, not less in fact than in the fancy of Mrs.
          Radcliffe. To all appearance it had been temporarily and very lately abandoned. We established ourselves in
          one of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments. It lay in a remote turret of the building.
          Its decorations were rich, yet tattered and antique. Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with
          manifold and multiform armorial trophies, together with an unusually great number of very spirited modern
          paintings in frames of rich golden arabesque. In these paintings, which depended from the walls not only in
          their main surfaces, but in very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the chateau rendered necessary
          -- in these paintings my incipient delirium, perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so that I bade
          Pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room -- since it was already night -- to light the tongues of a tall
          candelabrum which stood by the head of my bed -- and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains of black
          velvet which enveloped the bed itself. I wished all this done that I might resign myself, if not to sleep, at
          least alternately to the contemplation of these pictures, and the perusal of a small volume which had been
          found upon the pillow, and which purported to criticise and describe them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Long -- long I read -- and devoutly, devotedly I gazed. Rapidly and gloriously the hours flew by and the deep
          midnight came. The position of the candelabrum displeased me, and outreaching my hand with difficulty, rather
          than disturb my slumbering valet, I placed it so as to throw its rays more fully upon the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated. The rays of the numerous candles (for there were
          many) now fell within a niche of the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the
          bed-posts. I thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before. It was the portrait of a young girl just
          ripening into womanhood. I glanced at the painting hurriedly, and then closed my eyes. Why I did this was not
          at first apparent even to my own perception. But while my lids remained thus shut, I ran over in my mind my
          reason for so shutting them. It was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought -- to make sure that my
          vision had not deceived me -- to calm and subdue my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze. In a very
          few moments I again looked fixedly at the painting.
        </p>
        <p>
          That I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt; for the first flashing of the candles upon that canvas
          had seemed to dissipate the dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses, and to startle me at once into
          waking life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The portrait, I have already said, was that of a young girl. It was a mere head and shoulders, done in what
          is technically termed a vignette manner; much in the style of the favorite heads of Sully. The arms, the
          bosom, and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into the vague yet deep shadow which formed
          the back-ground of the whole. The frame was oval, richly gilded and filigreed in Moresque. As a thing of art
          nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. But it could have been neither the execution of the
          work, nor the immortal beauty of the countenance, which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me. Least of
          all, could it have been that my fancy, shaken from its half slumber, had mistaken the head for that of a
          living person. I saw at once that the peculiarities of the design, of the vignetting, and of the frame, must
          have instantly dispelled such idea -- must have prevented even its momentary entertainment. Thinking
          earnestly upon these points, I remained, for an hour perhaps, half sitting, half reclining, with my vision
          riveted upon the portrait. At length, satisfied with the true secret of its effect, I fell back within the
          bed. I had found the spell of the picture in an absolute life-likeliness of expression, which, at first
          startling, finally confounded, subdued, and appalled me. With deep and reverent awe I replaced the
          candelabrum in its former position. The cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view, I sought
          eagerly the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories. Turning to the number which designated
          the oval portrait, I there read the vague and quaint words which follow:
        </p>
        <p>
          "She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee. And evil was the hour when she
          saw, and loved, and wedded the painter. He, passionate, studious, austere, and having already a bride in his
          Art; she a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee; all light and smiles, and
          frolicsome as the young fawn; loving and cherishing all things; hating only the Art which was her rival;
          dreading only the pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments which deprived her of the countenance of
          her lover. It was thus a terrible thing for this lady to hear the painter speak of his desire to pourtray
          even his young bride. But she was humble and obedient, and sat meekly for many weeks in the dark, high
          turret-chamber where the light dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead. But he, the painter, took
          glory in his work, which went on from hour to hour, and from day to day. And be was a passionate, and wild,
          and moody man, who became lost in reveries; so that he would not see that the light which fell so ghastly in
          that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his bride, who pined visibly to all but him. Yet she
          smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly, because she saw that the painter (who had high renown) took a fervid
          and burning pleasure in his task, and wrought day and night to depict her who so loved him, yet who grew
          daily more dispirited and weak. And in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its resemblance in low
          words, as of a mighty marvel, and a proof not less of the power of the painter than of his deep love for her
          whom he depicted so surpassingly well. But at length, as the labor drew nearer to its conclusion, there were
          admitted none into the turret; for the painter had grown wild with the ardor of his work, and turned his eyes
          from canvas merely, even to regard the countenance of his wife. And he would not see that the tints which he
          spread upon the canvas were drawn from the cheeks of her who sate beside him. And when many weeks bad passed,
          and but little remained to do, save one brush upon the mouth and one tint upon the eye, the spirit of the
          lady again flickered up as the flame within the socket of the lamp. And then the brush was given, and then
          the tint was placed; and, for one moment, the painter stood entranced before the work which he had wrought;
          but in the next, while he yet gazed, he grew tremulous and very pallid, and aghast, and crying with a loud
          voice, 'This is indeed Life itself!' turned suddenly to regard his beloved: -- She was dead!
